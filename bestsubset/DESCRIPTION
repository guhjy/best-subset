Description: An implementation of best subset selection in regression based on a
  mixed integer quadratic program formulation of the subset selection problem,
  and the Gurobi mixed integer program optimizer; also, tools for running
  simulations comparing best subset selection to other common sparse regression
  estimators such as the lasso and forward stepwise.
